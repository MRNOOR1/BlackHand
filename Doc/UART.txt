Use Interrupts When:

  1. Time-critical response needed (<1ms)
    - Example: Encoder pulses, high-speed communication
  2. Rare events that you can't afford to miss
    - Example: Emergency stop button, fault signals
  3. Hardware peripheral requires it
    - Example: UART RX (don't want to poll constantly), ADC conversion complete

  Use Tasks (Polling) When:

  1. Human interface (buttons, switches)
    - Humans can't press faster than 10ms anyway!
  2. Periodic operations
    - Example: Read sensor every 100ms
  3. Complex logic needed
    - Example: State machines, multi-step processes
  4. You want simple code
    - Tasks are easier to write and maintain

  📊 Comparison for YOUR Button:

  | Aspect            | Interrupt (Current) | Task (FreeRTOS)             |
  |-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
  | Response time     | ~1 microsecond      | ~10 milliseconds            |
  | User perception   | Instant             | Instant (10ms unnoticeable) |
  | Code complexity   | Higher              | Lower                       |
  | CPU usage         | Minimal             | Slightly higher             |
  | FreeRTOS-friendly | Needs care          | Native                      |
  | Debouncing        | Manual timing       | Natural delay               |

  For a button: Both work fine! 10ms delay is imperceptible to humans.
